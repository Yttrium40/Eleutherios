This is a Discord bot that learns and creates phrases using a Markov chain.
When added to a server, it will learn from any messages sent on any channel.
If a message is sent on a channel that contains the word "bot", it will send a message of its own!

To use:
First you need a Discord account and a bot. Both of these can be made on Discord's website: https://discordapp.com/
Your bot has a unique token, which needs to be entered as the TOKEN constant in Eleutherios.py
Install the latest version of Python 3 and the Discord.py library, using the instructions at https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
Add your bot to a server and run Eleutherios.py in a terminal to activate it!
